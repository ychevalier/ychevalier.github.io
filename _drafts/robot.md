# WISDOM (Pragmatic Programmer)

## What do you want them to learn?
- Which problem I wanted to solve
    - Make a robot (for fun)
    - Using a reusable architecture (2 robots with different motors and sensors)
    - Think - Sense - Act paradigm

## What is their interest in what you've got to say?

## How sophisticated are they?

## How much detail do they want?

## Whom do you want to own the information?

## How can you motivate them to listen to you?


## Story 

### (The robot)
Ok, so this has been by far my longest project. I started building this robot in 2002, when I was 12. It's not like I knew electronics, coding or anything back then, I just happened to stumble upon a monthly publication, the ones where you get parts of a product and that are really cheap for the first few issues and then get quite expensive and last a really long time before you get the actual, complete, advertised product (?). 
It happened just like that, except in the process I got to build my first robot, from scratch, and see that it wasn't that much, and I also got to learn about existing robots, technology and people actually making different kind of robots. For me it was the kickstarter of wanting to build moving things! And then... Nothing happened...
The truth is, when you're a kid, it is quite difficult to get into electronics. It is complicated, you need components, which costs money (that you don't have), even if you have the money there was no place to buy them from in France, pre-internet. And even if you had them, well... You needed to design circuits and solder stuff which was just not something I could even grasp at the time. So I turned to software, which is the cheapest way of building big stuff! I actually spoke about this with my classmates at uni, and most of us who started coded young comes from that exact same place: wanting to build stuff but lacking money, know-how and an helping environment.

Anyway, I built Cybot (that's its name) until I had a fully working robot that could avoid obstacles, follow light, or a black line on the floor, depending on the selecting mode. It was inspiring, but if the process was awesome, the finished product was just another toy. I left it somewhere hidden in my bedroom for years.

Until... Arduino. I was in engineering school studying software development when some friends and I became interested in the Arduino platform. It just seemed fun. Basically, it transformed electronics into software, something I could understand. After I build the basic circuits, I remembered my old robot and the next time I got back to my parents, I took the robot with me. I just wanted to remove all the electronics and plug everything in my Arduino.

Well, I learned that's not how you do it...

First I needed to make it move. You cannot power 2 6V DC motors with Arduino. You need a special circuit to do that. I found some on the internet (thanks ebay), but it was a bit above my understanding at the time. So I dug the internet for information.
