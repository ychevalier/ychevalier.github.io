Recently I spent some times with my kids building various vibrating robots. I first got the idea from a book I found at the public library.
It was a simple drawing robot and I had all the component in stock.

Basically we used an plastic cup, and used the hot-glue gun to glue two pens, and a motor with "something" attached to the shaft so it would move differently. We used a small electric coupler, but a glue ball, or any part of rubber would have done the job well.
I used a 2-AA battery holder and added a switch for good measure. We had tons of fun building it because my 5 years old could do it on its own! I actually had to solder dupont connectors on all the electronics because the connection were bad with just glue or tape. I used dupont because the kid could then connect the components with jumper wire by himself. It was a suprise to see it move that way on the whiteboard. It made some beautiful mandala-like drawings.

The second robot we built was from tutorials you'll find all over the internet if you look for a robot to build. It is a simple brush, as in toothbrush for us, but it can be as big a you like. You mount the biggest motor you can on it, add something to the shaft to off balance it (the big secret the make a motor vibrate!), and voila!

It always turned but in big(-ish) circles, so we put it on a table to clean the crumbs. The moving pattern was really like the one we have on our roomba, if we want to clean a specific spot.

Being me, I got obsessed by building simple robots and I ordered some books about it. The best ones I found were by [Kathy Ceceri](https://www.kathyceceri.com/): [Robotics](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009093LZS/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1) and [Making Simple Robots](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U1VU2AQ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6). She wrote the most instructive books about making robots with almost nothing, and understanding how it connected with "grown-up" robotics. I highly recommends both as they kind of follow each other, in information and in skills.

The first project from it we did was the one I found beautiful and I might have ordered the book in the first place for that project alone!
It is a really clever, vibrating (of course) _tensegrity_ robot. What is tensegrity you ask? Well, according to Ceceri, the term was coined by Buckminster Fuller (The geodesic dome guy, also known for the spaceship earth idea) and is a contraction between _tension_ and _integrity_, to designate a structure that would stand by tension and compression alone. It was first an architect subject but some roboticist from NASA later used it for some kind of fall-proof robot (more in [Making Simple Robots](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U1VU2AQ/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i6)). 
In the book, they propose to use plastic straws and rubber bands to achieve such a structure. Just making it is in its own amazing. You add the rubber bands to the straw, one by one and at some point, you cut the initial bands, and the structure expands! You then can add a vibrating motor somewhere on the structure and everything starts to vibrate and move. That part is actually not that impressive and we had to move the motor to get better results. Ceceri also uses a coin cell vibrator that needs quite a lot of power to work, thus having wires outside of it. We tried that but the wires where preventing the structure from moving freely. I prefered to use a simple motor that I could power with an onboard coin battery. I think the way to go is to multiply the vibrating motors and controlling them remotely, but that's for another day!

Anyway, if you're a parent, a beginner tinkerer or simply a person interested in robots, you'll just love making the simplest possible robots, with mostly stuff that you've got at home. I think vibrating robots are the way to go to begin because it removes all the frustration you get from more traditional projects. You don't need to build a proper chassis and vibrating always take the robot somewhere unexpected, which makes the robot more interesting, especially for kids.

For the parts, I just scavenged some old toys. The bigger motors where from toy cars that were not working anymore, the smaller motors from RC helicopters that were broken. Each copter had 3 small DC motors attached to it! 
The glue gun is essential though, GO GET A GLUE GUN! They are so much fun!
